  <summary>Initial Setup</summary>
  
# Initial Setup
- [Download the latest forge version](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html "Download Forge")
- Run it to install forge  

- Open minecraft launcher and check if forge's profile is there, if not then you can create it ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74936369/111808098-b8d7bf00-88e4-11eb-8a2d-60e93b1406a5.png)
- **Windows**: Press windows+r and type %appdata%/.minecraft/
- **Linux**: .minecraft is located in your home folder. ~/.minecraft
- **Mac**: do âŒ˜ (Command) + Space type "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/
- Create a folder called "mods" if it isnt there already. then put the mods you download inside that folder and start minecraft.
## Note
- **Check all the options a mod has!** - Many people randomly turn on all features and then complain to the mod developer saying they don't want that feature on. It is up to the user to look through and test each setting to see what they do instead of bothering the mod developer about it.
- **Do not download random mods** - If you want to download mods, whether it be from this list or externally, do some reaserch into what it actually does and if you want it. Many people download old, broken mod folders that cause issues and have a bunch of mods that they aren't even using but are killing their performance. Please only get mods that you know you want and make sure to keep them updated.

  <summary>Mods you should avoid</summary>

# Mods you should avoid - Alternatives
| Mod | Reason |
| --- | --- |
 [**LabyMod**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/ "Alternative") | LabyMod causes a ton of incompatibilities with other mods because the devs love overwriting stuff for no reason like the entirety of the tab and stealing features and it is not recommended.
 [**SkyblockExtras**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/ "Alternative") | SBE is heavily obfuscated, making it incompatible with many mods, is paid and therefore violates [Mojang's EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula), and has a ton of problems causing crashes and visual glitches, and the developer steals stuff and is an all around terrible person pepelaugh.
 [**SkyblockCatia**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/blob/main/SkyblockCatia.md "Alternative") | Causes a ton of incompatibilities.
 **Skypixel** | Unmaintaned and no longer works for Skyblock.
 [**SpiderFrog's OAM**](https://sk1er.club/beta "Alternative") | has over 7mb of bloat and causes crashes. Instead you can use [**Sk1er's OAM**](https://sk1er.club/beta "Alternative") which is currently in beta.
 [**Orange Marshall's OAM**](https://sk1er.club/beta "Alternative") | doesnt look like 1.7, missing animations like old sneaking animation, overwrites many things unnecessarily causing other mods to break, like OptiFine's custom item texture. Instead you can use [**Sk1er's OAM**](https://sk1er.club/beta "Alternative") which is currently in beta.
 **PlayerAPI** | This used to be a requirement for most togglesneaks but fortunately enough developers now know how access transformers actually work and aren't lazy. 
 [**ResourcePack Organizer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZFWrrEcYM "Alternative") by Chylex | overwrites the custom sky for some bizarre reason lmao and he has no plans to update old versions. Instead you can use [Resourcepack Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZFWrrEcYM "Alternative") by Aycy.
 **ModCore Container** | was used to allow players to try out [ModCore](https://sk1er.club/modcore) before it was a thing, but now ModCore is auto installed with all [Sk1er Mods](https://sk1er.club/ "Sk1er's Website")/Partnered developer's mods and in any mod that contains it.
 **BetterFPS** | Useless and can cause a LOT of issues, [example1](https://twitter.com/asbythh/status/1260072556989644800?s=20 "BetterFPS 'optimizations' test"), [example2](https://streamable.com/rthpah "BetterFPS 'optimizations' test"), [example3](https://streamable.com/bmnum3 "BetterFPS 'optimizations' test"), [example4](https://streamable.com/q4ip5u "BetterFPS 'optimizations' test"), as changing the base math the game depends on is a VERY bad idea, fast beacon and fast hopper are server side features so they are also useless, horrible mod overall.
 **TexFix** | Useless unless you have a big modpack (50 or more mods) and can barely lower memory usage. contrary to popular belief, this mod CANNOT improve fps as for obvious reasons. It can also make textures become 2D.
 **FoamFix** | The 1.8.9 version is a useless and hacky mod. However, the 1.12.2 version is fine.
 **1.8.9 TcpNoDelay** | Useless as 1.8.1 and above already has this enabled. This mod will only work on 1.8.0 and below.
 [**Vanilla Enhancements**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | Overwrites many things unnecessarily causing other mods to break, like overwriting chat and having a bannable feature, unmaintained, abandoned which is why some features are broken and not getting fixed. Instead [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") takes some of its best features and fixes them.
 **Inventory and Mouse Tweaks** | Many players get these mods to help sort their inventories in Skyblock, however they are both bannable and are not advised.
 [**MouseDelayFix**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative")  | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**MouseBindFix**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**CaseCommands**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**CommandPatcher**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**CompactChat**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") has a new improved rewrite of it.
 [**CrossChat**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**Frames+**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | Horrible mod that used to break performance but had some nice features which [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Download Patcher") now takes continuation of & improves upon.
 [**ItemOptimizations**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**ResourceExploitFix**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already has a better improved version of it.
 [**WindowedFullscreen**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**CleanView**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**FastChat**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**MemoryFix**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | stops the game from trying to free memory in most cases, [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it and improves upon some of its features.
 [**NoCloseMyChat**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**VoidChat**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**Fullbright**](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") | [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher "Alternative") already replaces it.
 [**isXander's Togglesprint**](https://download.powns.dev/togglesneak189 "Alternative") | The togglesprint had the cheat "KeepSprint". Although their later work is safe, it is not recommended to download their older mods.
 [**Mushway Particles Mod**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PPR_t-qyfw) | The famous particles mod sent extra attack packets with no swing packets in order to create more particles, causing tons of false bans and huge controversy surrounding the youtuber as youtubers such as tenebrous started talking about it.
**JustEnoughDungeons (JED)** | The well-known dungeons mod that thrived from stealing other features from other mods ended up being token logged and caused damages for many players to lose their accounts and money, the owner later on addressed it and faked his ownership with another account disgusing as an "old friend" of the original owner then bypassing Hypixel mod blacklist by changing the modid, then exposed very shortly after by asbyth.

**Note: Patcher does not steal any features and those were either their own mods or added by permission. this is only 5% of what the mod has and not by any means "most" of its features.**

# Common Issues [WIP]
| Issue | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
 **Connected textures** | OptiFine 1.8.9 currently has an issue with connected textures causing crashes. Only "Fancy" is effected, so use "Fast" instead.
 **Abandoned 5Zig** | The old 5Zig can cause a lot of issues due to it no longer being maintained. It is recommended that you switch to [RoccoDev's 5Zig Reborn](https://5zigreborn.eu/ "Alternative") instead.
 **Having ModCore in your mods folder** | Please refrain from putting ModCore in your mods folder as it can cause crashes, it is not the actual way to install ModCore and might cause issues, if you have a [Sk1er LLC](https://sk1er.llc "Sk1er's Website") mod(s)/partnered mod(s) you shouldnt worry about the installation of ModCore as it installs itself.
 **Config corruption** | On the off-chance that one of your config files become corrupted, simply delete the config and relaunch Minecraft. A new, working config file will be created.
 **Incompatible mods** | Some mods may be incompatible with each other. These are usually the result of one (or both) of the mods being poorly made. Please check if there are better alternatives.
 **Using same features with different mods** | As a result of lazy developers some mods might overwrite entire classes and if two mods overwrite one class it'll  crash and for example having two old animations mods is useless and will cause issues with the game.
 **Allocating more ram than you should** | You should never allocate more ram than the game actually needs, doing so might actually have negative affects because the game is dumping unused resources into the ram and in the case of memory leaks your system will no longer have ram to actually operate itself or other programs, 2-4 GB should be fine.

  <summary>Ways to Prevent Crashing</summary>

# Ways to Prevent Crashing [WIP]
| Issue | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
 **Update your mods** | We're all lazy to click that one button that says your mods are outdated but always keep your mods up to date! It is important to always keep your mods to the latest version so that you always have the latest fixes.
 **Don't download a mods folder** | While there is nothing wrong with downloading the mods folder, it is wrong to just blindly use them. First you should check which of the mods in the folder you actually want/need, and then make sure that they are updated to the latest version.
 **Don't use bad mods** | Some examples of bad mods are Labymod, Spiderfrog's OAM, Orange Marshall mods, FoamFix, TexFix, Vanilla Enahncements and BetterFps. There are many mods that are poorly made and have better alternatives, and so it is best to avoid them.
 **Check what you use** | In some cases people use mods they dont really need whether it be from sketchy mod creators or mods from a youtuber's mods folder which you shouldnt get in the first place, for example shady skyblock mods they downloaded from the Hypixel forums that they dont know what the use for them is and sometimes its plain malware so check what you download and becareful since those mods might be the ones crashing your game or potentially stealing your personal information.
