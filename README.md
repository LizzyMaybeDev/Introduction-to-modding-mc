![3](https://regex.rest/media/forgefordummies/3.png)

- Open minecraft launcher and check if forge's profile is there, if not then you can create it ![4](https://regex.rest/media/forgefordummies/4.png)
- Now that we're done with forge you can press windows+r and type %appdata% and open the .minecraft folder, then create a folder called "mods" if it isnt there already

## Recommended Mods
- [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.8.9_HD_U_M5.jar) - General visual and performance enhancing mod.
- [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher) - If you're wondering what patcher does check [this](https://github.com/LunaNotdev/Patcher-Explanation/blob/main/README.md) thing I've made with all of its features, it's essentially a performance mod filled with bug fixes and quality of life features - a must have in every forge folder.
- [Old Animations Mod](https://sk1er.club/beta) - This one is sk1er's OAM which is currently in beta and it already has an entire rewrite coming soon, its more accurate than orange's OAM and Spiderfrog's OAM and made to be compatible with other mods.
- [Powns Togglesprint](https://download.powns.dev/togglesneak189) - Adds a sprint and sneak toggle similar to that in Minecraft 1.15 and above, but does not allow for sneaking in inventories in order to be 1.8 compliant.
- [Resourcepack Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZFWrrEcYM) - This is the best version of resource pack manager as the resource pack organizer Chylex made had some issues with custom sky.
- [Cowlection](https://github.com/cow-mc/Cowlection/releases) - A client-side only Forge mod that contains a collection of features (mainly for skyblock but otherwise its a good mod).
- [Scrollable Tooltips](https://sk1er.club/mods/text_overflow_scroll) - For GUI Auto users. Allows tooltips to be scrolled through or moved left/right.

## Mods you should avoid - Alternatives

- [LabyMod](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/LabyMod-Alternatives) - LabyMod causes a ton of incompatibilities with other mods because the devs love overwriting stuff for no reason like the entirety of the tab and stealing features and it is not recommended.
- [SkyblockExtras](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Skyblock-Extras-Alternatives) - SBE is heavily obfuscated, making it incompatible with many mods, is paid and therefore violates [Mojang's EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula), and has a ton of problems causing crashes and visual glitches, and the developer steals stuff and is an all around terrible person pepelaugh.
- SkyblockCatia - Causes a ton of incompatibilities, see [SBE alternatives](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Skyblock-Extras-Alternatives).
- Skypixel - Unmaintaned and no longer works for Skyblock, see [SBE alternatives](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Skyblock-Extras-Alternatives).
- [SpiderFrog's OAM](https://sk1er.club/beta) - has over 7mb of bloat and causes crashes. Instead you can use [Sk1er's OAM](https://sk1er.club/beta) which is currently in beta.
- [Orange Marshall's OAM](https://sk1er.club/beta) - doesnt look like 1.7, missing animations like old sneaking animation, overwrites many things unnecessarily causing other mods to break, like OptiFine's custom item texture. Instead you can use [Sk1er's OAM](https://sk1er.club/beta) which is currently in beta.
- PlayerAPI - This used to be a requirement for most togglesneaks but fortunately enough developers now know how access transformers actually work and aren't lazy. 
- [ResourcePack Organizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZFWrrEcYM) by Chylex - overwrites the custom sky for some bizarre reason lmao and he has no plans to update old versions. Instead you can use [Resourcepack Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZFWrrEcYM) by Aycy.
- Modcore Container - was used to allow players to try out [Modcore](https://sk1er.club/modcore) before it was a thing, but now modcore is auto installed with all [Sk1er Mods](https://sk1er.club/)/Partnered developer's mods and in any mod that contains it.
- BetterChat - Overwrites the chat, hopefully getting a rewrite soon as the developer promised.
- BetterFPS - Useless and can cause a LOT of [issues](https://twitter.com/asbythh/status/1260072556989644800?s=20) as changing the base math the game depends on is a VERY bad idea, fast beacon and fast hopper are server side features so they are also useless, horrible mod overall.
- TexFix - Useless unless you have a big modpack and can barely lower memory usage. It can also make textures become 2D.
- FoamFix - The 1.8.9 version is a useless and hacky mod. However, the 1.12.2 version is fine.
- 1.8.9 TcpNoDelay - Useless as 1.8.1 and above already has this enabled. This mod will only work on 1.8.0 and below.
- [Vanilla Enhancements](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher) - Overwrites many things unnecessarily causing other mods to break, like overwriting chat and having a bannable feature its also unmaintained and abandoned which is why the chat tabs are broken and never getting fixed. Instead [Patcher](https://sk1er.llc/mods/patcher) takes some of its best features and fixes them.
- Inventory and Mouse Tweaks - Many players get these mods to help sort their inventories in Skyblock, however they are both bannable and are not advised.
